# Markov-Chain-Text-Generator
A web application to use to create new text based on a template text.<br />
Do you like nonsense text?<br />
Do you want to fill pages with unqiue documentation that nowone reads but are a requirement text?<br />
Well here is a small project that generates random text based on a given text (for context).

Keep in mind, the longer the text provided the more gramatically correct sentences it creates.
